What is Ansible? or Why Ansible?
	Anisble is an open source configuration management and deployment tool written in Python.
	It can also do IT orchestration, where you have to run tasks in sequence and create a 
	chain of events which can run on several different servers or devices. 
	
What are the other tool similar to Anisble?
	Salt Stack , CF engine , Chef , Puppet these are the tool similar to Anisble.
	These tools are konwn as infrastructure as a code.
	
What is the meaning of infrastructure as a code?
	Using these tools we can perform below activity
		installing software.
		upgrade of OS
		Downgrade of OS
		Install patches
		deploy application
	So these tools are konwn as infrastructure as a code.

Adventage in Ansible?
	Ansible is first processing.
	we no need to install the agent in the nodes.
	Ansible work as push mechanisim  
	Easy to write the program using YAML.
	Ansible is inbuild SSH.
	
Terminology in Ansible?
	modules , template , inventory file , playbook , roles , tasks , plays , 
	ansible galexy , ansible tower etc...

What is ansible config file?
	Some settings in Ansible are adjustable via a configuration file (ansible.cfg).
	Ansible search its configuration file in following order:

		ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)
		ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
		~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
		/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
	If you install ansible through package manager (yum) then the latest ansible.cfg 
	file should be present in /etc/ansible.

Inventory file / hosts file
=====================================
	The Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which 
	commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate.
	The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts.
	We can change as per the our Ansible environment and plugins.
	The inventory file can list individual hosts or user-defined groups of hosts 
	on which we can perform the some operational and configuration tasks.
	
	Example of a hosts file
	------------------------
		host1.example.net 		
		
		[nodeservers]
		192.168.33.70

		[routers]
		router1.example.net 
		router2.example.net
		
		[switches]
		switch1.example.net
		switch2.example.net 																							

We can write the inventory file in the form of yaml or json format.

ex--> Yaml format
      ------------
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ cat hosts.yaml
		---
		control:
			hosts:
				192.168.33.60:
		yamlnodes:
			hosts:
				192.168.33.70:
				192.168.33.75:
			vars:
				ansible_become: true
				ansible_become_pass: suman345
		linux:
			children:
				yamlnodes:	
				
Note --> if you are changing the default path of the "hosts" file then you need
mention the path in "ansible.cfg " ( is not mandatory you can use  -i option in 
ansible to call you inventory file)
	ex -->
		[uansible@yamlserver ansible]$ grep -i -v "^#" ansible.cfg | grep -i -v "^$"
		[defaults]
		inventory      =/home/uansible/ansibleDir/hosts
		sudo_user      = root	
	ex -->
		[uansible@yamlserver ansible]$ grep -i -v "^#" ansible.cfg | grep -i -v "^$"
		[defaults]
		inventory      =/home/uansible/ansibleDir/hosts.yaml
		sudo_user      = root
		
what are the different modules ( give some names)
==========================================================
ping , command , shell , ad-hoc ,  file  , raw , service , debbug , copy , yum  , apt , 
template , mail , git , user , group , mount , docker 

Ping modules
===============
	To check the connection with the nodes we can use ping module.
	
		[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible nodeservers -m ping 		# nodeservers is the group of ips
		
			192.168.33.70 | SUCCESS => {
		"ansible_facts": {
			"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
		},
		"changed": false,
		"ping": "pong"
		}																													
	
	To check indivisual ip is pinging or not.
	----------------------------------------------
		[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible 192.168.33.70 -m ping -u uansible
		
			192.168.33.70 | SUCCESS => {
			"ansible_facts": {
				"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
			},
			"changed": false,
			"ping": "pong"
		}
	
	ping with a particular user
	----------------------------
	Ansible will default to running from your user account. 
	If you want to run commands as a different user use "-u usrname"
	
		[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible nodeservers -m ping -u uansible
		
			192.168.33.70 | SUCCESS => {
		"ansible_facts": {
			"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
		},
		"changed": false,
		"ping": "pong"
		}

 If you want one line output use  "-o" option
 
[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible -m ping linux -o

192.168.33.70 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"}, "changed": false, "ping": "pong"}
192.168.33.75 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"}, "changed": false, "ping": "pong"}
[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$
[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible -m ping all -o
192.168.33.75 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"}, "changed": false, "ping": "pong"}
192.168.33.70 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"}, "changed": false, "ping": "pong"}
[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$

ad-hoc  module
===================
	The ad-hoc module is something which might do something realy fast but donot want to
save for later.

    how to ran ad-hoc commands / how to Work with Patterns
    ------------------------------------------------------
	The basic command consists of "ansible" then host groups from "hosts" to run 
	    against, "-m <module-name>" optionally providing the agrguments via "-a ARGS"
	
		ansible <host_group> -m <module_name> -a <arguments>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
|	When running any command with the Ansible ad-hoc CLI pay attention to quoting rules		|
|	Using double execute the command in the same machine, where Single quotes would 		|
|	evaluate the variable on the box you were on.							|
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m shell -a "echo $HOSTNAME"
	
		192.168.33.75 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		yamlserver.host			##### here command executed in same machine
		
		192.168.33.70 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		yamlserver.host
	
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m shell -a 'echo $HOSTNAME'
	
		192.168.33.70 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		yamlnode1.host			##### here command executed on the box where you were on
		
		192.168.33.75 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		yamlnode2.host
	 
if you want to read the list of hosts from a file, prefix the file name with ‘@’.
		
	vi ips.txt
	      192.168.33.70
	      192.168.33.75
			
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible 192.168.33.* -m ping --limit @ips.txt
		
		192.168.33.70 | SUCCESS => {
			"ansible_facts": {
				"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
			},
			"changed": false,
			"ping": "pong"
		}
		192.168.33.75 | SUCCESS => {
			"ansible_facts": {
				"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
	 		},
			"changed": false,
			"ping": "pong"
		}
	
  
if you want to use all hosts form the inventory in ansible you can use      "all" or "*"

	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible all -m ping --limit @ips.txt
						or
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible 192.168.33.* -m ping --limit @ips.txt


How to get the hostname 
-----------------------------
     ansible  -i  /home/ujam/ansibleDir/hosts.yaml  all  -a "hostname -s" -o
	
		192.168.33.95 | CHANGED | rc=0 | (stdout) jenkinMaster
		192.168.33.97 | CHANGED | rc=0 | (stdout) jenkinslave1
		192.168.33.99 | CHANGED | rc=0 | (stdout) jenkinslave2
		192.168.33.60 | CHANGED | rc=0 | (stdout) yamlserver

What is the use of ad-hoc 
--------------------------
Using ad-hoc , module we can do all the below activity
	Parallelism and Shell Commands
	Gathering Facts
	File Transfer
	Managing Packages
	Users and Groups
	Deploying From Source Control
	Managing Services
	Time Limited Background Operations

command module 
-----------------------------------
	*)  ansible yamlnodes -m command -a 'ls -lR'   # list the file and dectory recursivly
	*)  ansible yamlnodes -m command -a 'mkdir -p /home/uansible/yamlDir/ansibleTopic'    # create a dicrectory
	
	reboot the system parallely using the "reboot" command with ansible command module for 
all servers in "yamlnodes" group in 5 parallel forks:
	
	*)	ansible yamlnodes -m command -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 5 		# -a is arguments , -f is fork / --fork
	
Difference between command module and shell module
=====================================================
The command module does not support extended shell syntax like piping and redirects.
In command module we can use  shell variables.

Shell module
----------------------------
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m shell -a 'echo $HOSTNAME'
	
	192.168.33.70 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
	yamlnode1.host
	
	192.168.33.75 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
	yamlnode2.host
	
Ansible will default to running from your user account. If you want to run commands as a different user use "-u usrname"
if you are not using a passwordless privilege ( ssh passwordless )for different user it will interactively 
prompt you for the password to use.

	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m shell -a "ls -lrt| grep ""^-" | awk print '{$9}' " -u uansible 
		
		192.168.33.70 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		a
		destinationsample.txt
		destinationSample.txt
		
		192.168.33.75 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		a
		destinationsample.txt
		destinationSample.txt
		
if you are not using any user "-u user_name"  and use  "-k --become"  then default will be "root" user.

	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m shell -a "ls" -u uansible -k --become
		SSH password:
		192.168.33.70 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		a
		destinationsample.txt
		destinationSample.txt
		
		192.168.33.75 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
		a
		destinationsample.txt
		destinationSample.txt

Gathering facts / setup module
=====================================
	The facts are pieces of information regarding the remote systems to which you have connected.
	It contains information like IP addresses, the OS installed, Ethernet devices, mac address, 
	time/date related data, hardware information etc.
	
	By useing "setup" module you can gather fact about the hosts. 
	
		ansible -m setup all
		
		ansible -m setup 192.168.33.75

copy module / File module 
=====================================
	*) The "copy" module use to copy file from server to multiple nodes concurrently.
	
	src ==> source 
	dest ==> destination
	
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m copy -a "src=/home/uansible/ansibleDir/sample.txt
dest=/home/uansible/destinationSample.txt"


	*) Using the "file" module we can transfer the file as well as change the ownership and permissions on files. 
		
		[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m file -a "dest=/home/uansible/destinationSample.txt mode=600"
		
		[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m file -a 'dest=/home/uansible/destinationSample.txt mode=777 owner=ansible group=ansible' --ask-pass -K --become
								or
		[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m file -a 'dest=/home/uansible/destinationSample.txt mode=777 owner=ansible group=ansible' --ask-become-pass -K --become

difference between  " --ask-become-pass " and " --ask-pass"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
	for password authentication we can use "--ask-pass".
	If using sudo features and when sudo requires a password, supply "--ask-become-pass"


*) The file module can also create directories, similar to mkdir -p
	
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m file -a "dest=/home/uansible/testDir mode=775 owner=ansible group=uansible state=directory" -u uansible
						or by using sudo
	[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ ansible yamlnodes -m file -a "dest=/home/uansible/testDir mode=775 owner=ansible group=uansible state=directory" --ask-become-pass -K --become

*) Also using "file" module we can delete directories (recursively) and delete files:

	 ansible yamlnodes -m file -a "dest=/home/uansible/ state=absent" --ask-become-pass -k --become

Different state in file module
-----------------------------------
  absent , directory ,hard ,link , touch
  
  absent --> delete directories (recursively) and delete files
  directory --> create directories, similar to mkdir -p
  hard	--> create or change  hard link
  link --> create or change  symbolic  link
  touch --> an empty file will be created if file not exist in the path, else updated file access and modification times

			playbook
			============	  
Playbooks are the files where Ansible code is written. Playbooks are written in YAML format (Yet Another Markup Language)
playbook uses 4 space indentation and use 'ansible-playbook' to execute playbook

Lets consider an example to create file through playbook
=================================================================

[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$ cat  createAfile.yml
---
- hosts: yamlnodes
  tasks:
      - name: create a file using ansible
        file:
            path: "/home/uansible/yamlDir/ansibleTopic/playbookFile"
            state: touch
[uansible@yamlserver ansibleDir]$

check the syntax of the playbook
----------------------------------------------
ansible-playbook createAfile.yml --syntax-check

execute playbook
--------------------
 ansible-playbook createAfile.yml
 
 
EX2 ---> create file with data using copy module in yaml.
-------------------------------------------------------------

[uansible@yamlserver playbooks]$ cat 2createFileWithDat.yml
---
- hosts: yamlnodes
  tasks:
  - name: Create file with the containt using copy module
    copy:
      dest: "/home/uansible/yamlDir/ansibleTopic/fileWithData.txt"
      content:
        I am reading playbook.
        To create file with the containt i am using copy module
        copy module has an option "content" to write the content in file.
[uansible@yamlserver playbooks]$


Loop in ansible
==========================
in ansible "{{ item }}" create a loop and check for "with_items" option.

EX3--> Create multiple files using "file" module and "with_items" option in ansible yaml code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[uansible@yamlserver playbooks]$ cat 3createMutiFile.yml
---
- hosts: yamlnodes
  tasks:
  - name: Create multiple files using "file" module and "with_items" option in ansible yaml code
    file:
      path: "/home/uansible/yamlDir/ansibleTopic/{{item}}"
      state: touch
      mode: 0775
    with_items:
    - accessfile.log
    - systemfile.log
    - propertiesfile.txt
    - conffile.log
[uansible@yamlserver playbooks]$

Ex4 --->  create muiltple file with different permissions
------------------------------------------------------------------

[uansible@yamlserver playbooks]$ cat 4multiFileWithDiffPermission.yml
---
- hosts: yamlnodes
  tasks:
  - name: Create multiple file with different permision
    file:
      path: "/home/uansible/yamlDir/ansibleTopic/{{item.location}}"
      state: touch
      mode: "{{item.mode}}"
    with_items:
    - {location: '4_file1.txt' , mode: '0644'}
    - {location: '4_file2.txt' , mode: '0750'}
[uansible@yamlserver playbooks]$
