Instate of mentioning everything in hosts/inventory file  
we can mention groupvars and hostvars in two different folders
Bydefault ansible-playbook command look for  group_vars/ and host_vars/ directory in the current working directory
But the other Ansible commands like ansible, ansible-console, etc look for  group_vars/ and host_vars/ directory inside the inventory directory.

group_vars/              # in this folder
|--yamlnodes (ex it is the group1 )
|--jenkinsmaster (ex it is the group2)

host_vars/  # in this folder
|--jenkinMaster ( ex it is the indivisual host )
|--jenkinslave2 ( ex it is the indivisual host )


vi host_vars/jenkinslave2   ( ex content present in the file )
