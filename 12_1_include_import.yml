# In Ansible we can reuse the content with include and import and roles 
# All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
# All include* statements are processed as they encountered during the execution of the playbook.
# So import (import_playbook, import_tasks, etc.) is static. 
#    include (include_tasks, include_role, etc.) is dynamic.
# "include: {{ codename }}.yml " 


# In the below example include a playbook

- include: 9_1_blocks.yml
